At OpenAI, we have long believed image generation should be a primary capability of our language models. That’s why we’ve built our most advanced image generator yet into GPT‑4o. The result—image generation that is not only beautiful, but useful.

A wide image taken with a phone of a glass whiteboard, in a room overlooking the Bay Bridge. The field of view shows a woman writing, sporting a tshirt wiith a large OpenAI logo. The handwriting looks natural and a bit messy, and we see the photographer's reflection.

The text reads:

(left)

"Transfer between Modalities:

Suppose we directly model

p(text, pixels, sound) \[equation\]

with one big autoregressive transformer.

Pros:

\\* image generation augmented with vast world knowledge

\\* next-level text rendering

\\* native in-context learning

\\* unified post-training stack

Cons:

\\* varying bit-rate across modalities

\\* compute not adaptive"

(Right)

"Fixes:

\\* model compressed representations

\\* compose autoregressive prior with a powerful decoder"

On the bottom right of the board, she draws a diagram:

"tokens -> \[transformer\] -> \[diffusion\] -> pixels"

Make an image of a four‑panel strip, with some padding around the border:

A little snail is at the counter of a flashy car showroom. The salesman has leaned way over the desk to even see him.

Close‑up on the snail looking very serious. He says, “I want your fastest sports car… and I want you to paint big letter ‘S’s on the doors, the hood and the roof.”

The salesman is scratching his head. “Um… we can do that, but why the S’s?”

Smash cut to a red blur roaring down the highway. The sports car is covered in giant S’s. People on the sidewalk are pointing and laughing: “WOW! LOOK AT THAT S‑CAR GO!”

## Useful image generation

From the first cave paintings to modern infographics, humans have used visual imagery to communicate, persuade, and analyze—not just to decorate. Today's generative models can conjure surreal, breathtaking scenes, but struggle with the workhorse imagery people use to share and create information. From logos to diagrams, images can convey precise meaning when augmented with symbols that refer to shared language and experience.

GPT‑4o image generation excels at accurately rendering text, precisely following prompts, and leveraging 4o’s inherent knowledge base and chat context—including transforming uploaded images or using them as visual inspiration. These capabilities make it easier to create exactly the image you envision, helping you communicate more effectively through visuals and advancing image generation into a practical tool with precision and power.

## Improved capabilities

We trained our models on the joint distribution of online images and text, learning not just how images relate to language, but how they relate to each other. Combined with aggressive post-training, the resulting model has surprising visual fluency, capable of generating images that are useful, consistent, and context-aware.

### Text rendering

A picture is worth a thousand words, but sometimes generating a few words in the right place can elevate the meaning of an image. 4o’s ability to blend precise symbols with imagery turns image generation into a tool for visual communication.

Create a photorealistic image of two witches in their 20s (one ash balayage, one with long wavy auburn hair) reading a street sign.

Context:

a city street in a random street in Williamsburg, NY with a pole covered entirely by numerous detailed street signs (e.g., street sweeping hours, parking permits required, vehicle classifications, towing rules), including few ridiculous signs at the middle: (paraphrase it to make these legitimate street signs)"Broom Parking for Witches Not Permitted in Zone C" and "Magic Carpet Loading and Unloading Only (15-Minute Limit)" and "Reindeer Parking by Permit Only (Dec 24–25)\\n Violators will be placed on Naughty List." The signpost is on the right of a street. Do not repeat signs. Signs must be realistic.

Characters:

one witch is holding a broom and the other has a rolled-up magic carpet. They are in the foreground, back slightly turned towards the camera and head slightly tilted as they scrutinize the signs.

Composition from background to foreground:

streets + parked cars + buildings -> street sign -> witches. Characters must be closest to the camera taking the shot

### Multi-turn generation

Because image generation is now native to GPT‑4o, you can refine images through natural conversation. GPT‑4o can build upon images and text in chat context, ensuring consistency throughout. For example, if you’re designing a video game character, the character’s appearance remains coherent across multiple iterations as you refine and experiment.

## Photorealism and style

Training on images reflecting a vast variety of image styles allows the model to create or transform images convincingly.

He’s clutching multiple glossy shopping bags filled with luxury goods. His coat flutters behind him in the wind, and one of the bags is swinging as if he’s mid-stride.

## Limitations

Our model isn’t perfect. We’re aware of multiple limitations at the moment which we will work to address through model improvements after the initial launch.

![cropping](https://images.ctfassets.net/kftzwdyauwt9/2sWtvWI6hvI1kpHferQ3XR/98167a66b9135608ed58a62d173e3951/crop2.png?w=3840&q=90&fm=webp)

We’ve noticed that GPT‑4o can occasionally crop longer images, like posters, too tightly, especially near the bottom.

![Hallucinations](https://images.ctfassets.net/kftzwdyauwt9/4q2NxPTrsqOpQxZxSVUU7z/bca86408b3b2061bbf377965c6d589ce/crop.png?w=3840&q=90&fm=webp)

Like our other text models, image generation can also make up information, especially in low-context prompts.

![High binding problems](https://images.ctfassets.net/kftzwdyauwt9/21nVyfD2KFeriJXUNLbLFN/a54cf3e09e9d3560ec092d4856808769/perodictable.png?w=3840&q=90&fm=webp)

When generating images that rely on its knowledge base, it may struggle to accurately render more than 10-20 distinct concepts at once, such as a full periodic table.

![Precise graphing](https://images.ctfassets.net/kftzwdyauwt9/3UCsC12gbUIO14b42MLNzA/bf1d19553a357eb6a32a44721748b2b5/graph.png?w=3840&q=90&fm=webp)

![Multilingual text rendering](https://images.ctfassets.net/kftzwdyauwt9/19O1J1EPpaQVSJobPAJUq0/d042f63a48da46e57b937988aa4d920c/korean.png?w=3840&q=90&fm=webp)

The model sometimes struggles withrenderingnon-Latin languages, and the characters can be inaccurate or hallucinated, especially with more complexity.

![Editing precision](https://images.ctfassets.net/kftzwdyauwt9/3cdcfsEh90cB113RK1iBfx/78bfb918d56cb2a024d51cc85175718d/Screenshot_2025-03-24_at_3.57.29_PM.png?w=3840&q=90&fm=webp)

We’ve noticed that requests to edit specific portions of an image generation, such as typos are not always effective and may also alter other parts of the image in a way that was not requested or introduce more errors. We’re currently working on introducing increased editing precision to the model.

We’re aware of a bug where the model struggles with maintaining consistency of edits to faces from user uploads but expect this to be fixed within the week.

![Dense information with small text](https://images.ctfassets.net/kftzwdyauwt9/4MDiQPSrpvEnXlPLiIjkof/b2431ac47cfda64f59843d5570dc02d0/Screenshot_2025-03-24_at_3.59.45_PM.png?w=3840&q=90&fm=webp)

The model is known to struggle when asked to render detail information at a very small size.

## Safety

In line with our Model Spec, we aim to maximize creative freedom by supporting valuable use cases like game development, historical exploration, and education—while maintaining strong safety standards. At the same time, it remains as important as ever to block requests that violate those standards. Below are evaluations of additional risk areas where we're working to enable safe, high-utility content and support broader creative expression for users.

**Provenance via C2PA and internal reversible search** All generated images come with C2PA⁠ metadata, which will identify an image as coming from GPT‑4o, to provide transparency. We’ve also built an internal search tool that uses technical attributes of generations to help verify if content came from our model.

**Blocking the bad stuff** We’re continuing to block requests for generated images that may violate our content policies, such as child sexual abuse materials and sexual deepfakes. When images of real people are in context, we have heightened restrictions regarding what kind of imagery can be created, with particularly robust safeguards around nudity and graphic violence. As with any launch, safety is never finished and is rather an ongoing area of investment. As we learn more about real-world use of this model, we’ll adjust our policies accordingly.

For more on our approach, visit the image generation [addendum to the GPT‑4o system card⁠](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4o-image-generation-system-card-addendum/).

**Using reasoning to power safety** Similar to our [deliberative alignment⁠](https://openai.com/index/deliberative-alignment/) work, we’ve trained a reasoning LLM to work directly from human-written and interpretable safety specifications. We used this reasoning LLM during development to help us identify and address ambiguities in our policies. Together with our multimodal advancements and existing safety techniques developed for ChatGPT and Sora, this allows us to [moderate⁠](https://openai.com/index/upgrading-the-moderation-api-with-our-new-multimodal-moderation-model/) both input text and output images against our policies.

## Access and availability

4o image generation rolls out starting today to Plus, Pro, Team, and Free users as the default image generator in ChatGPT, with access coming soon to Enterprise and Edu. It’s also available to use in Sora. For those who hold a special place in their hearts for DALL·E, it can still be accessed through a dedicated DALL·E GPT.

Developers will soon be able to generate images with GPT‑4o via the API, with access rolling out in the next few weeks.

Because this model creates more detailed pictures, images take longer to render, often up to one minute.
